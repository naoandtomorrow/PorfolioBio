     <h3> About Naoling </h3>
    </span>
     <p> Throughout my life I've always wanted to be a professional problem solver, I just didn't know what specific area of problem-solving I wanted to be in.  
        At first, I wanted to be a criminal defense lawyer, I attended a legal studies magnet program throughout high school, 
    I was a part of the debate club, chess club, and mock trial.
 After high school, I received the American Dream scholarship for being a first-generation immigrant. 
 With that I decided to get my associate's degree in psychology, I loved learning about the human mind and why we behave the way we do, 
 why we constructed social cues and was planning on using that as a base starter for my career as an attorney. 
 But, three semesters before my graduation I got a job as a traveling data analyst and I loved it.</p>
 <p> 
For the last two years, I have been moving from state to state working as a data analyst for a staffing company with government contracts. 
My first contract was in Los Angeles, California, my second one was in Chicago, Illinois and lastly, I was in San Francisco, California. 
Each contract taught me new abilities, and as I continued to learn, I ventured into the world of independent work. I discovered that my preferred
way of working more efficiently was the atmosphere of my computer, a deadline, and me. 
I researched for weeks on data analyst courses, but I found something that called me more: Software Engineering courses. 
I ran into Thinkful's course and knew it was perfect. 
As a student at Thinkful, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be more ecstatic. 
If you're looking to hire a new developer, please reach out! I'm very excited to learn from others and share my knowledge to build transformative software.
